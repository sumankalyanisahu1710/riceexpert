<h1>PLOUGHING</h1>
<p>Open up the soil during the summer season to expose weed seeds to sunlight and reduce the weed seed bank. It helps to store the soil moisture during cropping period.

<h1>ROTAVATOR TILLAGE</h1>
<p>The rotavator are immensely used in cultivating digging and leveling the land for growing the crops and many other for plantation. It is very helpful for the farmers for cultivation particularly used for shallow tilling of soil.  It has features like smooth performance, high efficiency and low oil consumption.

<h1>LASER LEVELLING</h1>
<p>Good land leveling helps ensure high yield and reliable production crops. This is best achieved using laser assisted land leveling. A level field allows planters/drills to place seed more precisely and enables more uniform irrigation, leading to a uniform crop stand and improved weed control and fertilizer use efficiency. Leveling also helps to reduce irrigation water input.

<h1>PUDDLING</h1>
<p>Puddling is the most important operation for preparation of soil bed for transplanting the rice seedlings. Puddling is associated with churning of the soil to change its physical properties like bulk density, percolation rate, porosity and penetration. This process helps to check the weed growth, conserve the water and nutrients and ultimately to improve the crop yield. Puddling is done in standing water of 50-100mm depth in the field that has already been ploughed once in dry conditions.
